# ALPR YOLO Models by [NeuralNet](https://neuralnet.solutions) 🚗

This repository provides **open-source Automatic License Plate Recognition (ALPR) models** built on the YOLO11 architecture. Our models are designed for high-performance license plate detection and recognition across various real-world scenarios.

![ALPR Demo](assets/demo.gif)

The complete solution includes:
- **High-accuracy YOLO11-based ALPR models** for license plate detection
- **Gradio web interface** for easy testing and deployment  
- **Ollama integration** for OCR text extraction from detected plates
- **Docker support** with GPU acceleration
- **Production-ready** inference pipeline

## 📋 Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch with CUDA support (recommended)
- Docker (optional, for containerized deployment)
- Ollama server for OCR functionality

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Download the model weights:**
```bash
# Download from our latest release
wget https://github.com/NeuralNet-Hub/assets/releases/download/v0.0.1/alpr-yolo11s-aug.pt
```

2. **Clone the inference repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/NeuralNet-Hub/ultralytics-ollama-OCR.git
cd ultralytics-ollama-OCR
```

3. **Install dependencies:**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. **Run the application:**
```bash
python main.py --model alpr-yolo11s-aug.pt
```

## 📊 Model Performance

Our ALPR models have been extensively trained and validated to provide:
- **🎯 High Accuracy**: Robust detection across various lighting conditions and angles
- **⚡ Fast Inference**: Optimized for real-time applications  
- **🌐 Versatile**: Works with different vehicle types and license plate formats
- **📱 Easy Integration**: Compatible with existing Ultralytics workflows

### Training Metrics

All training data, metrics, and experimental results are available at:
**[WandB Project: ALPR-by-hdnh2006](https://wandb.ai/hdnh2006/ALPR-by-hdnh2006/)**

## 🐳 Docker Deployment

### Build and Run with GPU Support

```bash
# Build the image
docker build -t yolo-ollama-ocr .

# Run with GPU support
docker run --gpus all -p 7860:7860 yolo-ollama-ocr

# Run with host network (for local Ollama server)
docker run --gpus all --network host yolo-ollama-ocr
```

## 💡 Usage Examples

### Web Interface

Access the Gradio interface at `http://localhost:7860` to:
- Upload images for license plate detection
- Adjust confidence and IoU thresholds
- Configure Ollama server for OCR
- View detected plates with extracted text

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Ollama Server Setup

The application integrates with Ollama for OCR functionality:

1. **Install Ollama**: Follow instructions at [ollama.ai](https://ollama.ai)
2. **Pull a vision model**: `ollama pull qwen2.5vl:3b`
3. **Configure server URL** in the Gradio interface

### Model Selection

Available pre-trained models:
- `alpr-yolo11s-aug.pt` - Small model, fast inference
- Custom models supported via the web interface

## 📁 File Structure

```
.
├── main.py                 # Main application with Gradio interface
├── requirements.txt        # Python dependencies
├── Dockerfile             # Docker configuration
├── alpr-yolo11s-aug.pt   # Pre-trained ALPR model
└── README.md             # This file
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**CUDA out of memory:**
- Reduce image size or batch size
- Use CPU inference: `model.predict(device='cpu')`

**Ollama connection failed:**
- Verify Ollama server is running
- Check server URL configuration
- Ensure vision model is installed

**Poor detection accuracy:**
- Adjust confidence threshold (try 0.1-0.5)
- Ensure good image quality and lighting
- Consider using larger model variants
